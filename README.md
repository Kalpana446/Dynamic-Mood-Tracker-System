# Dynamic-Mood-Tracker-System
A multimodal emotion detection system using text, speech, and facial emotion analysis with stress detection and task recommendation.

## Project Description
This project detects human emotions using multiple modalities:
* Text input emotion analysis
* Speech-to-text emotion analysis
* Facial emotion detection using a pre-trained DeepFace model
The detected emotions are combined to analyze stress levels and provide task recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Vader Sentiment Analysis
- Speech Recognition
- DeepFace
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Features
- Dynamic user text input
- Audio-based emotion detection
- Facial emotion detection (pre-trained model)
- Stress alert logic
- Task recommendation system
- Visual analytics

## Individual Project Declaration

This project was **designed, developed, and implemented individually** by me as part of my internship work.

Although the internship initially allowed group collaboration, due to **topic disagreements and to ensure clarity and quality of implementation**, I chose to complete this project **independently**.

All stages of the project — including:
- Problem understanding
- System design
- Data handling
- Model integration
- Implementation
- Testing
- Visualization and analysis  

were carried out **solely by me**.

## Internship Details
* Company: Amdox Technologies
* Duration: 1 Month
